_The greatest gap in life is the one between knowing and doing. -Richard Biggs_    


* Those moments where you say _What was I thinking?_  
* The difference between _knowing code_ and _doing code_  
* Ever heard of the [_Knowing - Doing gap_](https://xplane.com/the-knowing-doing-gap/), it's real and it's not easy to accept the gap  
* This _personal folder_ is dedicated to my attempts of _crossing_ that gap
